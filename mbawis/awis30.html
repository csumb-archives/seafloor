      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#FF0066">This 
        year the Association for Women in Science will be celebrating our 30th 
        anniversary.</font> AWIS was founded on April 17, 1971 by a small group 
        of women who wanted to improve the position of women in the sciences. 
        We would like to get AWIS chapters and members involved in the 30th anniversary 
        events. The kickoff event occurred in February at the AWIS reception in 
        San Francisco, California. Many local chapter members were able to attend. 
        AWIS Fellows were announced at this reception and their names are listed 
        on the web site. There will be an article on the reception in the upcoming 
        AWIS magazine. </b></font> 
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
        national office has added a <font color="#FF0066">30th anniversary page 
        to our web site (http://www.awis.org/30th.html)</font>. This will include 
        pearls of wisdom from notable women and a list of all the events occurring 
        this year. As you may know, pearls are the traditional symbol representing 
        30th anniversaries. </b></font> 
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#FF0066">An 
        essay contest will be organized for both high school girls and undergraduate 
        women.</font> The subject will be what they envision about science in 
        the 21st century and women's role in the sciences. Winning essays will 
        be published in the AWIS magazine and placed on the web site. Prizes for 
        winning essays will be presented at the October Leadership Conference 
        in Washington, DC. The tentative deadline for essay submissions is mid-August. 
        The essays will be read and evaluated by an advisory committee. The national 
        office welcomes members to submit names of potential advisory committee 
        members to Krishna Shah at shah@awis.org. Further details about the essay 
        contest will be in the AWIS magazine and on the 30th anniversary web page.
