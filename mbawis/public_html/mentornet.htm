      <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Would you 
        like to share your experiences with a college or graduate student? Help 
        her understand what it is like to work in industry? Provide support as 
        a woman student pursues a science or engineering education?</font></p>

          <i>working in close collaboration with AWIS</i>, is seeking engineering, 
          scientific and technical professionals to mentor women engineering and 
          science students on-line! In today's U.S. workforce, women are just 
          over 9% of the engineers and approximately 30% of the scientists. Women 
          students earn 17% of the engineering, 32% of the physical science, and 
          41% of all science and math degrees. Mentoring is an effective strategy 
          for increasing the retention rates of women in these fields. </font></li>

        <li><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#800080">MentorNet</font></b> 
          provides a framework for the mentors and students to pursue the mentoring 
          relationship via email, and it offers on-line training and support for 
          mentors and students. Because it uses email and other electronic technologies, 
          it can link many more students and mentors than traditional mentoring 
          programs that rely on face-to-face meetings. MentorNet will be working 
          with more campuses in the United States that serve minority students, 
          and is also beginning to expand internationally. To reach its goal of 
          3,500 mentors for the 2001-2002 academic year, MentorNet needs about 
          1,500 more mentors to pair community college, college, and university 
          women studying engineering, science, or math with men and women professional 
          scientists and engineers for a year-long email relationship. </font></li>
