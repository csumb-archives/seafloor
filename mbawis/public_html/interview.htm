<p><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Worried about the dreaded interview? Want 
  to learn about good interviewing skills from actual interviewers? Science's 
  <i>Next Wave</i> (<a href="http://www.nextwave.org">www.nextwave.org</a>) will 
  be presenting our<b> "Interviewing Skills for Scientists"</b> program on <b>February 
  19</b> during the annual AAAS meeting at the Hilton San Francisco and Towers. 
  The workshop will begin with a mock interview, demonstrating both "good" and 
  "poor" interviewing skills. We will have an expert panel (composed of scientists 
  from industry and other careers) to provide comments on the mock interview as 
  well as offer advice on what makes a candidate shine. Before we break for a 
  reception, a human resources (HR) professional will highlight what to expect 
  in the HR portion of a job interview, and you'll get to ask all of our experts 
  your questions about the interview process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">This workshop occurs directly following 
  the <b>Science Career Fair (10AM-4PM)</b>. Throughout the day, there are other 
  career workshops. For a small entrance fee of $10 for AAAS members and $25 for 
  non-members, you can attend all of these workshops. </font></p>
