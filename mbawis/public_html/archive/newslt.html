Both                 events, held at UCSC, were well attended and provided an opportunity                 to introduce mbAWIS to potential new members.</p>              <p> The Careers in Science Panel Discussion included four speakers                 from diverse backgrounds. We'd once again like to publicly thank                 the speakers: Julie Doerr, Lydia Gregoret, Erin Bradley and Elaine                 Bild. There has been a lot of positive feedback and requests that                 we hold another such event annually. If anyone would like to volunteer                 as a speaker or knows someone who would be good, please let us                 know (bolin@hydrogen.ucsc.edu). The public speaking event, thanks                 go to David Mulligan, also generated many positive comments.

Applications have been                 forwarded to each of the four local community colleges: Cabrillo,                 Gavilan, Hartnell and Monterey Peninsula. The competition is open                 to any woman student pursuing a science degree. The awards are                 worth $250 and one will be awarded to a student at each community                 college. </p>              <p> This year outstanding students will be nominated by one of the                 science professors and asked to submit supporting information,                 including a one page essay. Re-entry students are highly encouraged                 to apply. The deadline for applications is March 1 and the scholarship                 committee will decide on the winners by the beginning of April.                 Winners will be recognized at the Northern California Chapters                 annual awards dinner on April 29th at Genentech in South San Francisco.</p>              <p> &nbsp;</p>              <p> </p>              <hr align="LEFT">              <p> &nbsp;</p>              <p> <font size="+1">News and Current Events</font></p>              <center>              </center>              <p> &nbsp;</p>              <p> --Monterey Bay-AWIS On-line!</p>              <p> We are in the process of developing a web site for our local                 Chapter! A web site is a practical, effective medium for disseminating                 information about Monterey Bay-AWIS. Elements of the site will                 include historical background on AWIS; Monterey Bay Chapter focus                 and goals; Board member and Committee chair contact information;                 calendar of events; outreach opportunities; newsletter archive;                 password protected access to Members database and Executive Board                 meeting minutes; links to National AWIS and other Northern California                 Chapters web sites; links to UCSC Women in Science web page; and                 much more. Members without computer-access will continue to receive                 postal notices of upcoming meetings and programs. We are seeking                 student assistance for this project and are currently drafting                 a job description for submission to students in the CSUMB Web                 Design course.

Take first right (towards the ocean)                 onto Moss Landing Road- after you pass the PGE power stacks (on                 the left/east). The exit road is BEFORE the pink Whole Enchilada                 restaurant. From Moss Landing Road take the first right onto Sandholdt                 Road. Cross over the one-way bridge and follow the road around                 the harbor. You will pass by the huge MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium                 Research Institute) building, and Phil's Fishmarket on your left.                 The Moss Landing Marine Labs &quot;Norte&quot; building is on                 the left about 4 buildings after Phil's. The conference room is                 upstairs.</p>              <p> &nbsp;</p>              <p> From the South:</p>              <p> Hwy 1 north to Moss Landing. Take the first left onto Moss Landing                 Road- the turn off is adjacent to ML Liquors (on the west corner).                 Go straight- past the cemetery and post office. Then, from Moss                 Landing Road take a left onto Sandholdt Road. Cross over the one-way                 bridge and follow the road around the harbor. You will pass by                 the huge MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) building,                 and Phil's Fishmarket on your left. The Moss Landing Marine Labs                 &quot;Norte&quot; building is on the left about 4 buildings after                 Phil's. The conference room is upstairs.</p>              <p> &nbsp;</p>              <p> Parking:</p>              Parking is not restricted except where signs are posted.
