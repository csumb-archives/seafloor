        FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE (AAAS), PROGRAM ON EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, 
        INTERNATIONAL DIVISION announces </font><font size="2" face="Century Gothic"><b>WOMEN'S 
        INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION (WISC) PROGRAM 2001 - 2002 OVERVIEW 
        </b></font>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2">The Women's International Science Collaboration 
        (WISC) Program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and 
        administered by the Program on Europe and Central Asia of the American 
        Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Because the application 
        rate of women scientists and engineers to the Central and Eastern Europe 
        Program of the Division of International Programs has been disproportionately 
        low, the goal of this Program is to increase the participation of women 
        as PIs and co-PIs in international research projects. This program provides 
        grants to individual US scientists who plan to establish new research 
        partnerships with their colleagues in Central/Eastern Europe (CEE) and 
        the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS). The grant, 
        up to $4,000, will provide travel and living support for the US womn scientist 
        and, when appropriate, an additional grant of $4,000 to her American male 
        or female co-PI. Each scientist will be responsible for arranging accommodations. 
        The grant does not cover salary or institutional expenses (e.g. overhead). 
        US scientists can spend up to four weeks in the partner country to develop 
        a research program and design. Expenses can also be used to cover material 
        and supplies needed during the stay. Where excess funds exist and with 
        the aproval of AAAS administrators, grants funds can also beused to support 
        a second visit to the partner country or for a foreign partner to travel 
        to the US hen such a visit is deemed necessary. The grants are not to 
        be used for the sole purpose of attending conferences or workshops or 
        teaching or training. The program will be administered by AAAS. The grantee's 
        home institution will be responsible for overseeing the grantee's adheren! 
        ce to NSF and federal guidelines regarding administration of the grant.</font>

      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><b>ELIGIBILITY</b> Men and women scientists 
        who have their Ph.D.s or equivalent research experience are eligible to 
        apply. Applications from male co-PIs must be accompanied by an application 
        from a female co-PI as part of a US research team. They must be US citizens 
        or permanent residents of the US. Male and female graduate students (Ph.D. 
        candidates) are also eligible to apply, if they will be conducting research 
        in an established Ph.D. program in the US and will be traveling with their 
        Ph.D. advisor and will serve as co-PI on future proposals. Government 
        employees can only apply if they also are affiliated with another institution 
        eligible to receive NSF grants(e. g. an adjunct professorship at a university). 
        Specialists who have received their doctoral degrees within the past six 
        years will receive special consideration, as will specialists applying 
        to work with colleagues in less frequently represented countries and regions. 
        Scientists and engineers who have an existing NSF grant and are eligible 
        for a NSF international supplment should not apply to this program. Please 
        contact NSF's Eastern Europe Program staff who can advise regarding applications 
        for NSF international supplements (cdudka@nsf.gov). </font>

        will not be considered. </font>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><b>SELECTION </b>The AAAS will then collect 
        and review the initial applcations for completeness. They will then send 
        them t the members of a five-person review panel who will read and rank 
        their appropriateness, keeping in ind NSF review requirements - scientific 
        relevance and impact. The evaluation of each proposal will take into account: 
        (1) applicant's technical abilities (scientific accomplishments to date, 
        including significance of publications in peer-reviewed journals and independent 
        research); (2)quality of the proposed project (specificity and significance 
        of the project's objectives, including expected contributions to the specific 
        discipline and to the greater scientific community); (3) feasibility of 
        carrying out the proposed project (capabilities of proposed hosts in the 
        research area, including availability of required facilities; ability 
        of visitor to work in a Western environment; and ability of visitor to 
        communicate effectively with colleagues); and (4) prospects for long-term 
        collaboration following the completion of the current project. These issues 
        should be addressed in the five-page description of the project. </font>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><b>GRANT CONDITIONS </b>All grants will be 
        administered by and disbursed through the grant recipient's institution. 
        This includes visa, travel, and other arrangements in compliance with 
        NSF and other federal regulations. AAAS grants will not cover any overhead 
        or other indirect charges assessed by universities (or by other institutional 
        organizations). The American specialist who is applying through her institution 
        must certify in writing that such chages will be waived. AAAS grants do 
        not provide for salary replacement. The AAAS shall have no responsibility 
        for costs incurred beyond those covered in the grant as itemized in fellowship 
        application and which are reasonable, allowable and allocable to the effort 
        undertaken. Expenses are not to exceed $4,000. Any unspent funds remaining 
        at the conclusion of the visit shall be returned to AAAS. In addition, 
        should the actual duration of the visit(s) be less than the proposd duration, 
        the grant recipient will return to the AAS any unspent funds. If transoceanic 
        airfare costs are to be covered by the grant, AAAS policy nd the International 
        Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 1517) 
        (Fly America Act) require the use of U.S. Flag carriers for international 
        air travel to the extent these carriers are available. Business or First 
        Class travel is not permitted. In preparing their application budgets, 
        grantees should obtain fare quotations so as to ensure that their requests 
        are reasonable. AAAS staff will review air travel expense requests to 
        ensure reasonableness. Proof of these arrangements (ticket stub or receipt 
        coupon) must be submitted. If other funds are used for travel, documentation 
        supporting this action must be provided. The budget will also be evaluated 
        by AAAS staff and may be cut back if they exceed reasonable costs. </font>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><b>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</b> Within three 
        months of the trip, the grantee will be required to submit a trip report(according 
        to the WISC trip report guidelines), which includes an evaluation of the 
        trip, and a progress report on submitting a formal research proposal. 
        The grantee's institution will also be responsible for submitting an expense 
        report of travel funds (form provided) with copies of original receipts 
        within 60 days. Any excess funds will be returned to AAAS or plans to 
        expend the excess funds (i.e. a second visit by the American to the foreign 
        partners, a first visit by the partner to the US; equipment or supply 
        purchaes to enhance communications, etc.) will be outlined in the final 
        report. Upon approval from AAAS, the grantee can use the excess funds. 
        In this case, another report will be due within three months of the initial 
        report. </font>
