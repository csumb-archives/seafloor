        three working sessions began with each facilitator reviewing wall-size 
        tables and maps summarizing the pre-workshop surveys and proposing guidelines 
        & criteria for additional site selection based on the second workshop 
        notice information. Participants divided into subset groups, by agency, 
        to review Worksheet A and maps and identify the highest priority cells 
        (blocks) that were not already determined in the pre-workshop survey. 
        Participants were instructed to provide information on mapping needs and, 
        if available, any information on existing or planned data holdings related 
        to those identified blocks. Based on priority block identification for 
        each separate region, participants were instructed to determine block 
        priorities based on specific economic and environmental habitat parameters/ 
        criteria (e.g. fishery management, parallel use conflicts, zoogeographical 
        importance, etc) for all regions and blocks. </font></p>

      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
        a morning presentation on the issues surrounding data documentation and 
        data sharing, a breakout session was held to answer specific questions 
        and concerns and to determine whether or not an agreement could be crafted 
        and presented to the full conference. The roundtable discussion on data 
        sharing among resource agencies presented the following concerns: where 
        were existing data stored, what would be the format for disseminating 
        and repository for newly collected data, multiple platforms and data formats 
        to accommodate a variety of users, overhead cost associated with formatting 
        those data, classification of terms used in existing numerous (i.e. field 
        titles and data terms vary from user to user). As with multiple platforms, 
        there is considerable overhead with making data usable to other researchers. 
        Finally, some attendees were very concerned with the possible premature 
        release of data and QAQC. </font></p>

      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OBJECTIVE 
        - Discussion on the adoption of a universal marine habitat classification 
        scheme. Working group facilitated by Gary Greene, Moss Landing Marine 
        Labs and Tom Culliton, , NOAA, Special Projects Division. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A standard, 
        universally useful habitat classification scheme needs to be agreed to 
        if descriptions of habitats are to be accurately and efficiently applied 
        among scientific disciplines. In recent years, many marine benthic habitats 
        have been described using geophysical and biological data. These descriptions 
        can vary from one investigator to another, which make it difficult to 
        compare habitats and associated biological assemblages among geographic 
        regions. Using marine geophysical data collected with a variety of remote 
        sensor systems and in situ biological observations for habitat assessment 
        of deepwater rockfishes, Greene et al. (1999) constructed a classification 
        scheme that can be used in describing marine benthic habitats. It was 
        suggested that the scheme first be adapted to CDF&G and OSPR needs, and 
        then be used to reinterpret the marine geology maps of the entire California 
        continental shelf, compiled and published (1986) by Dr. Gary Greene of 
        the USGS and Mike Kennedy of the California Department of Conservation 
        Mines and Geology division (CDM&G), and digitized by the CSUMB group. 
        Each of these substrate maps has a companion metadata map of equal size 
        and scale defining and cataloguing the type, resolution, quality and source 
        for all of the original data used in the compilation, to produce a new 
        set of attributed GIS vector themes for essential marine habitats.</font></p>
