			Title:  CoastUTM
	Description:  
		Abstract:  California shoreline from the Oregon border to the Mexico border including Humboldt, Arcata, San Francisco, San Pablo, Suisun, Honker, and San Diego Bays and includes offshore rocks.
			
			This shoreline represents the mean high tide line along the coast. Accuracy of this coverage is fairly good with respects to the original source material.
		Purpose:  Used for spatial reference
		Supplemental_Information:  This coverage was originally compiled from individually digitized 7.5' USGS quadrangles controlled by NGS triangulation stations and individual quad corners. RMS errors averaged under 5 meters per quad.
