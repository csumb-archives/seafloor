  Description:
    Abstract: Information produced from this project contributes new seafloor images and maps that will be used to assess regional geology and characterize habitats critical to fisheries management and planning of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), as required by Federal mandates stated in the Magnunson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Sustainable Fisheries Act. Seafloor mapping effort was focused on priority areas outlined by multi-agency participants of the California Marine Habitat Task Force (CMHTF) Strategic Planning Meeting (1/20-21/2000).

    Purpose: These data are presented as part of a program objective to identify, quantify and synthesize existing information critical to the understanding of the linkage between fisheries and habitats. Before regional exploration and site specific studies are undertake in regard to Essential Fish Habitats (EFH), all possible data that can be used to characterize substrate of EFH should be examined and, where possible, used to delineate habitat. To complete this goal we identified, catalogued, digitized, re-interpreted, and archived proprietary industry data including side scan sonar mosaics, subbottom seismic profiles and bathymetry not previously available to the general scientific community for the purpose of providing critical marine habitat maps of the California margin. In areas where industry data did not overlap the recommendations of the CMHFT, the CSUMB state-of-the-art seafloor mapping facility acquired and processed new data.

    Supplemental_Information: Data Acquisition: Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V MacGinnite using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Differential GPS (DGPS) position data were generated by a Trimble 4700 GPS with differential corrections provided by a Trimble ProBeacon receiver. A TSS HDMS heading and motion sensor provided heave, pitch, heading, and roll data. Coastal Oceanographics Hypack software was used for survey design and execution. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International (TEI) Isis data acquisition system. Water column sound velocity  profiles collected using an AML SV+ sound velocity profiler.

  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Digital processing and mosaicking of sidescan data was accomplished using the Isis Sonar and Delph Map software packages (Triton-Elics International, Watsonville, CA) and TNT Mips GIS software (Microimages, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Individual trackline files were replayed and bottom tracking of the sonar was supervised to aid in proper slant-range correction. Line files were snipped to remove portions with poor imagery from the beginning and/or end of the trackline. Tracklines were the slant-range and layback corrected and the position data for each line was smoothed using a speed filter. Each line was then gridded, georeferenced and exported from Isis Sonar/Delph Map in GeoTIFF format (0.20m pixel size, UTM Zone 10 or 11, WGS84). Individual trackline Tiff images were imported into TNT Mips GIS software and areas of poor image quality were extracted and removed. Individual tracklines were then overlaid to produce a mosaic image. Geotiffs were exported from TNT Mips at 0.20m resolution.
