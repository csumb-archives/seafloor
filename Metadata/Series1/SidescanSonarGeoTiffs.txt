			Title:  Sidescan Sonar GeoTiffs
	Description:  
		Abstract:  Geophysical techniques that help identify and define large-scale marine benthic features are valuable in appraising essential habitats of marine benthic fish assemblages. Interpretations and verification of sidescan sonar, swath bathymetry, and backscatter imagery are useful tools for characterizing these habitats. Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected for the California Department of Fish and Game by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, Monterey Bay  using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder.
		Purpose:  To collect and process bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan sonar) data for marine habitat classification.
		Supplemental Information:  This file contains mosaicked backscatter imagery from CSUMB multibeam surveys, in GeoTiff format.  Data Acquisition: Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V MacGinnite using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Differential GPS (DGPS) position data were generated by a Trimble 4700 GPS with differential corrections provided by a Trimble ProBeacon receiver. A TSS HDMS heading and motion sensor provided heave, pitch, heading, and roll data. Coastal Oceanographics Hypack software was used for survey design and execution. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International (TEI) Isis data acquisition system. Water column sound velocity  profiles collected using an AML SV+ sound velocity profiler.

		Process Step:  
			Process Description:  Digital processing and mosaicking of sidescan data was accomplished using the Isis Sonar and Delph Map software packages (Triton-Elics International, Watsonville, CA) and TNT Mips GIS software (Microimages, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Individual trackline files were replayed and bottom tracking of the sonar was supervised to aid in proper slant-range correction. Line files were snipped to remove portions with poor imagery from the beginning and/or end of the trackline. Tracklines were the slant-range and layback corrected and the position data for each line was smoothed using a speed filter. Each line was then gridded, georeferenced and exported from Isis Sonar/Delph Map in GeoTIFF format (0.20m pixel size, UTM Zone 10 or 11, WGS84). Individual trackline Tiff images were imported into TNT Mips GIS software and areas of poor image quality were extracted and removed. Individual tracklines were then overlaid to produce a mosaic image. Geotiffs were exported from TNT Mips at 0.20m resolution.
