	Description:  
		Abstract:  Geophysical techniques that help identify and define large-scale marine benthic features are valuable in appraising essential habitats of marine benthic fish assemblages. Interpretations and verification of sidescan sonar, swath bathymetry, and backscatter imagery are useful tools for characterizing these habitats. Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected for the California Department of Fish and Game by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, Monterey Bay  using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder.
		Purpose:  To collect and process bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan sonar) data for marine habitat classification.
		Supplemental Information:  Data Acquisition: Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V MacGinnite using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Differential GPS (DGPS) position data were generated by a Trimble 4700 GPS with differential corrections provided by a Trimble ProBeacon receiver. A TSS HDMS heading and motion sensor provided heave, pitch, heading, and roll data. Coastal Oceanographics Hypack software was used for survey design and execution. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International (TEI) Isis data acquisition system. Water column sound velocity  profiles collected using an AML SV+ sound velocity profiler.

		Process Step:  
			Process Description:  Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using TSS HDMS data, variations in water column sound velocity using AML SV+ data, and adjusted to MLLW using predicted tide charts for the local region. Cleaning to remove erroneous soundings was completed in CARIS HIPS. Soundings were exported from CARIS HIPS as a decimated x,y,z ASCII text (shoal biased) with 1m, 100m, 300m, and 500m spacing. The 1m decimated x,y,z ASCII text is imported into Fledermaus AverageGridder to generate 1m grid(s). The 1m Fledermaus grid (.asc) was imported into Spatial Analyst to generate a 1m bathymetry grid.
