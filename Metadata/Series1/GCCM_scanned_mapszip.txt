	Description:  
		Abstract:  This California continental shelf geologic data set represents the current state of knowledge about the distribution of seafloor substrate types for the entire California continental shelf.  The data series is comprised of seven adjacent, but discrete map sections. Boundaries of seafloor geology type are depicted as polygon themes.
		Purpose:  This project created digital GIS format versions of California continental shelf geology hardcopy maps originally produced by the Division of Mines and Geology, the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Coastal Commission. In addition, geologic and bathymetric data were interpreted further to produce polygons representing habitat boundaries.
		Supplemental Information:  Original data developed by the Division of Mines and Geology, the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Coastal Commission. The principle purpose of the original DMG/USGS/CCC study was to acquire and compile all readily available geologic data for the California continental margin in a standard format. These nondigital data were presented as paper planimetric map sheets (NOAA/NOS 1:250,000 scale). For the current project, original mylars used to produce the geologic map series were scanned, and the resulting rasters were cleaned, georeferenced (UTM Zone 10 or 11, WGS84), and vectorized using TNTmips GIS software. Vector polygons and lines were then attributed and exported in ArcView shapefile format. Data covers an area from Mexico north to Oregon and from the California coastline west to the edge of the continental margin.

			Process Description:  Digital copy of hardcopy maps (1-7) from Geology of the California Continental Margin: Geologic Map Series, by Kennedy, Greene, and Clark (1987), published by the Division of Mines and Geology, the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Coastal Commission. Maps were scanned and georeferenced using grid coordinates from the hardcopy map(s). UTM zone 10, WGS84 was used from area maps 3 through 7, and UTM zone 11, WGS84 for maps 1 and 2.
