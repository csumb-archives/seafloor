		Abstract:  Geophysical techniques that help identify and define large-scale marine benthic features are valuable in appraising essential habitats of marine benthic fish assemblages. Interpretations and verification of sidescan sonar, swath bathymetry, and backscatter imagery are useful tools for characterizing these habitats. Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected for the California Department of Fish and Game by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, Monterey Bay  using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder.
		Purpose:  To collect and process bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan sonar) data for marine habitat classification.
		Supplemental Information:  Data Acquisition: Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V MacGinnite using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Differential GPS (DGPS) position data were generated by a Trimble 4700 GPS with differential corrections provided by a Trimble ProBeacon receiver. A TSS HDMS heading and motion sensor provided heave, pitch, heading, and roll data. Coastal Oceanographics Hypack software was used for survey design and execution. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International (TEI) Isis data acquisition system. Water column sound velocity  profiles were collected using an AML SV+ sound velocity profiler. Targets where the SV+ casts were taken were saved in Hypack.

		Process Step:  
			Process Description:  Target coordinates were exported from Hypack in x,y text format and imported into ArcView as a table. From this table an event theme was created, which was then converted to a shapefile. Sound velocity cast data were then linked as tables to each cast location.
