			Title:  habitat mb
	Description:  
		Abstract:  Geophysical techniques that help identify and define large-scale marine benthic features are valuable in appraising essential habitats of marine benthic fish assemblages. Interpretations and verification of sidescan sonar, swath bathymetry, and backscatter imagery are useful tools for characterizing these habitats. Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected for the California Department of Fish and Game by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, Monterey Bay  using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder.
		Purpose:  To collect and process bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan sonar) data for marine habitat classification.
		Supplemental Information:  Data Acquisition: Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V MacGinnite using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Differential GPS (DGPS) position data were generated by a Trimble 4700 GPS with differential corrections provided by a Trimble ProBeacon receiver. A TSS HDMS heading and motion sensor provided heave, pitch, heading, and roll data. Coastal Oceanographics Hypack software was used for survey design and execution. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International (TEI) Isis data acquisition system. Water column sound velocity  profiles collected using an AML SV+ sound velocity profiler.

		Process Step:  
			Process Description:  Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using TSS HDMS data, variations in water column sound velocity using AML SV+ data, and adjusted to MLLW using predicted tide charts for the local region. Cleaning to remove erroneous soundings was completed in CARIS HIPS. Sun-illuminated grayscale 1m bathymetric geotiffs and backscatter (sidescan) mosaics were were imported into ArcView v3.2 and displayed along with a California coastline shapefile. Maps were plotted at 1:4000, 1:5000, 1:5500 and 1:5000 scale for Monterey, Bodega Bay, Farallon Islands and Santa Barbara Island, respectively. Mylar sheets were over-layed on each map and habitat interpretations were outlined and codified on the mylar.  On each mylar, four tic marks and corresponding coordinates were used for reference.  In addition to the multibeam imagery maps, corresponding side scan sonar imagery maps were plotted to help interpret coarse sediment extents.  Each mylar was scanned using a Contex FSC 5010 (Contex A/S, Denmark). Mylars were scanned at 400dpi, in Black/White mode.  Mylars were scanned and saved as tiff images and imported into TNTmips as rasters which were georeferenced to UTM zone 10 or 11 (as appropriate) WGS84. The rasters were cleaned, converted to vectors, and cleaned again to remove any nodes that may have been missed in the raster cleaning process. The vectors were then smoothed and merged together within each site. Once again the merged vectors were cleaned in the areas where overlap occurred and  exported from TNT Mips as a shapefile. Within ArcView all of the polygons were attributed and quality control checked.
