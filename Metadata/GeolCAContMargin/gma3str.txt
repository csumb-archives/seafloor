	Description:  
		Abstract:  This California continental shelf geologic data set represents the current state of knowledge about the distribution of seafloor substrate types for the entire California continental shelf.  The data series is comprised of seven adjacent, but discrete map sections. Boundaries of seafloor geology type are depicted as polygon themes.
		Purpose:  This project created digital GIS format versions of California continental shelf geology hardcopy maps originally produced by the Division of Mines and Geology, the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Coastal Commission. In addition, geologic and bathymetric data were interpreted further to produce polygons representing habitat boundaries.
		Supplemental Information:  Original data developed by the Division of Mines and Geology, the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Coastal Commission. The principle purpose of the original DMG/USGS/CCC study was to acquire and compile all readily available geologic data for the California continental margin in a standard format. These nondigital data were presented as paper planimetric map sheets (NOAA/NOS 1:250,000 scale). For the current project, original mylars used to produce the geologic map series were scanned, and the resulting rasters were cleaned, georeferenced (UTM Zone 10 or 11, WGS84), and vectorized using TNTmips GIS software. Vector polygons and lines were then attributed and exported in ArcView shapefile format. Data covers an area from Mexico north to Oregon and from the California coastline west to the edge of the continental margin.

		Process Step:  
			Process Description:  Structural linework was rendered from archived mylar traces of the original mapping study (Kennedy et al 1987). Mylar sheet(s) were scanned and recorded as TIFF image(s). The image(s) was then imported into advanced image processing/analytical software (TNTmips, MicroImages, Inc.) and run through a series of data conversions. 
				
				Archive mylars were scanned using an adjusted black/white threshold mode to capture all lines. The raster image(s) was examined to detect any obvious distortions of the map and then saved in TIFF format. Using TNTmips v 6.3 software (MicroImages, Inc), the unprojected TIFF was imported and georeferenced. Coordinates for the control points were taken from the hardcopy Geology Series map(s) grids. Raster to vector conversion (auto-trace function), vector edits (danging nodes), object attributing and export to ArcView (ESRI) were performed within TNTmips. Geology and subsurface polygons, and structural (linework) features were extracted and saved to separate files. Feature merge, union, split, and edge-matching functions were performed in ArcView v 3.2. Attribute tables were reviewed and updated following each of these processes. Marker symbols were created for additional attributing of the structural features(s).
