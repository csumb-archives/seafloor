      <p class="style3">During the December 2005 Statewide Marine Mapping Planning Workshop, the participants ranked all state waters between Stinson Beach and A&ntilde;o Nuevo as the highest priority area in need of mapping along the Northern Central California coast (Monterey to Bodega Bays). The purpose of the collaborative project will be to survey and map as much state waters habitat (MHHW out to 3 nm) as possible within this high priority region. The team proposing this work is a uniquely qualified partnership between academia, industry and resource management comprised of the most experienced and highly skilled experts on seafloor mapping along the California coast. Members include the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University Monterey Bay, US Geological Survey National Seafloor Mapping and Benthic Habitat Studies Group, Fugro Pelagos Inc. and the Center for Habitat Studies at Moss Landing Marine Labs. Not only does this group bring years of regionally relevant professional experience to the project thereby ensuring a successful mapping campaign, but the broad involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the effort will contribute significantly to the training and education of young scientists skilled in the application of geospatial technology to coastal resource management issues. </p>
      <p class="style3">Acquisition of mapping data will be accomplished using bathymetric LIDAR and multibeam echo sounders (MBES) to obtain both bathymetry data and acoustic backscatter and reflectance imagery. The surveys and the information created will comply with the recommended requirements for statewide seafloor mapping as specified in the <a href="http://arcims.csumb.edu/DATA_DOWNLOAD/StrategicMapgWrkshp05/MappingWorkshop12_12-13/Final_Report/CA Habitat Mapping Rpt.pdf">Workshop Report</a>, including:<br>

These habitats included rocky reefs and sand flats within the Estero Bay from as close to shore as safe navigation allowed (approx 5m water depth), out to the 3nm state waters limit (approx 200m water depth). Within Morro Bay, mapping was focused on the navigable waterway and tidal creeks of sufficient depth to accomodate the survey vessel. Data produced will serve as the base habitat maps for species/habitat assessment and environmental change detection (with repeated mapping in future if funded). </font></P>

      <P align="left"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This survey, done in conjunction with the US Geological Survey (USGS), was carried out to assist with a study of the wave regime and sediment movement at Ocean Beach, San Francisco. Tthe new data reveal that dramatic changes have occurred at the SF Bay mouth since the last bathymetric survey conducted over 50 years ago. Upwards of 6 m of shoaling has occurred in the vicinity of the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) dredge spoil site, and new patterns in sand bar formation, seen for the first time in the bathymetry, explain the increased beach erosion. The tidal migration of massive dune fields at the bay mouth was also observed and quantified for the first time. These data are being used to develop and refine sediment transport and current models used by USGS and USACE to maintain the SF Bay entrance channel, adopt new dredge spoil disposal strategies and create a beach replenishment program to halt further erosion of Ocean Beach.</font></P>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Habitat change and 
        loss due to anthropogenic and natural factors is the major environmental 
        problem facing many coastal and estuarine resource management agencies. 
        Harbor creation adjacent to the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research 
        Reserve (ESNERR) has led to increased tidal scour that is rapidly eroding 
        the banks, salt marsh and main channel of Elkhorn Slough, destroying freshwater 
        wetlands, and inundating an active railroad line. There is also evidence 
        that seismic activity may be contributing to the loss of salt marsh habitat 
        and increased tidal scour. The purpose of the work proposed here will 
        be the development and implementation of an integrated system of RTK GPS 
        telephony, acoustic remote sensing, and marine GIS tools for marine habitat 
        mapping and change detection within the ESNERR. This collaborative work 
        will be undertaken with 4 industry partners involved in the commercial 
        development of new technologies in three main areas: 1) RTK GPS for hydrographic 
        survey applications, 2) automated seafloor substrate classification and 
        3) tidally explicit marine GIS. Working with Trimble Navigation, we will 
        be breaking new ground in RTK-based hydrographic surveying and on-the-fly 
        tidal modeling. Working with Triton-Elics and Quester Tangent, we will 
        be developing automated habitat discrimination products for classifying 
        subtidal estuarine habitats and plant communities using sidescan sonar 
        data. We will also be working closely with ESRI to provide the only estuarine 
        data set to be used in the development of the ArcGIS Marine Data Model. 
        The goal of this model is to create a Marine GIS capability for addressing 
        the multiple dimensionality and dynamism of marine data, handling the 
        temporal and dynamic properties of shoreline and coastal processes, dealing 
        with the inherent fuzziness of ocean boundaries, and the need for spatial 
        data structures that vary their relative positions and values over time. 
        <br>
        These new technologies will be developed, integrated and applied to achieve 
        the following research objectives at the ESNERR over the 3-year project 
        period to:<br>
        &middot; Classify and map the distribution of marine habitats within the 
        ESNERR<br>
        &middot; Determine the spatial and temporal distribution of rates of sediment 
        erosion, deposition and habitat change<br>
        &middot; Determine the elevations and rates of subsidence of the Southern 
        Pacific Railway across the salt marsh<br>
        &middot; Test the hypothesis that subsidence during 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 
        has contributed to tidal flooding and marsh loss in the headword region 
        of the Elkhorn Slough<br>
        The Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB, making use of its existing RTK GPS, 
        multibeam, sidescan and sub-bottom sonar survey systems, will be responsible 
        for all data collection. All geospatial results and products from the 
        research project will be made publicly available on-line via ESRI Internet

        high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, together with precisely geolocated 
        (&plusmn; 5m) ROV observations of fish distribution, to produce species-specific 
        and genus-specific habitat suitability models for eight rockfish (Sebastes) 
        species in the Del Monte shale beds of Monterey Bay, CA., USA. A high-resolution 
        (2m) multibeam bathymetry digital elevation model (DEM) was generated 
        and used to produce derived habitat characteristic layers [slope, rugosity, 
        and Topographic Position Index, (TPI)] using repeatable, non-subjective 
        algorithmic methods. These data layers, together with the positions and 
        counts by species from 229 rockfish observations (2892 total fish) were 
        then used to create predictive models of habitat suitability and fish 
        distribution. Factors evaluated for incorporation in the models included 
        depth, slope, rugosity, and TPI at various scales. Statistical and empirical 
        testing revealed that distance to a TPI50 &#147;peak&#148; was the most 
        effective predictor of fish location, while other factors (slope and rugosity) 
        seemed important but less significant. For this reason, distance to TPI50 
        peak was used as a simple indicator of habitat suitability for all species. 
        Between 62% and 89% of fishes from the eight species examined, and 87% 
        of all Sebastes, were found within optimal habitat as defined by this 
        simple model (Model 1), even though the optimal habitat comprised only 
        22% of the area surveyed for Sebastes. By incorporating depth, a refined 
        suitability model (Model 2) was created for four species. Model 2 optimal 
        habitat contained 89% of olive/yellowtail (S. serranoides/S. flavidus), 
        79% of brown (S. auriculatus), 78% of rosy, (S. rosaceus), and 78% of 
        flag (S. rubrivinctus) rockfish, while accounting for a lower percentage 
        (mean = 13%) of the total area surveyed. Both models were used to produce 
        stock estimates for all species and for all Sebastes, based on observed 
        densities of rockfish within the ROV survey area and total area of habitat 
        suitability classes in the overall shale bed study area. Model 1 estimates 
        approximately 53,000 Sebastes (of the eight spp. studied) in the shale 
        beds; substituting Model 2 estimates for the four relevant species raises 
        this estimate to approximately 54,000 fish.</font></p>

        acid (DA) through pelagic and benthic food chains, and 2) develop and 
        refine the use of two new species for monitoring DA in the environment. 
        Definitive evidence from Monterey Bay California has shown that during 
        P-n blooms, DA transferred through the pelagic food chain can present 
        a serious health hazard to high level marine picivorous predators (sea 
        lions and sea birds). In addition there is now evidence from some of these 
        same HAB events showing that DA also enters and moves through the nearshore 
        benthic food chain to sea otters, but with a significant time lag following 
        the causative bloom and appearance of DA in the pelagic food chain. This 
        benthic pathway and the reason for the apparent time lag, however, are 
        not known. Here our goal will be to test the hypothesis that DA is transferred 
        to the benthos via two spatially and temporally separated pathways. First, 
        intertidal filter feeders exposed to P-n containing surface waters may 
        ingest either P-n cells directly or zooplankters that have consumed P-n. 
        This first pathway would result in benthic toxicity contemporaneous with 
        pelagic toxicity. The second pathway involves the flocculation process 
        following the collapse of the P-n bloom, wherein P-n cells rain down and 
        form a scum or flock layer on the seafloor that is consumed by benthic 
        deposit feeders. This latter pathway would result in a time lag between 
        the appearance of DA in pelagic and intertidal benthic organisms and its 
        subsequent appearance in the more subtidal benthos. <span class="leaded"><font size="1"><a href="publications/capstones/goldberg_thesis.pdf">[MLML,

        The report includes: tables and maps summarizing the recommendations for 
        high priority sites and data gaps to be mapped and filled, a draft habitat 
        classification scheme, recommendations for compilation and processing 
        of existing data, and recommendations to facilitate data sharing among 
        task force members. The top ten sites<br>
        recommended for mapping included fishing blocks near: Point Arena, Farrallon 
        Islands, Cordell Banks, Monterey Peninsula, Point Sur, Channel Islands, 
        Long Beach, and Point Arguello. Fisheries management, parallel use conflicts, 
        and a need for general baseline data were the criteria most frequently 
        given as the reasons for selection of these priority data needs areas.

        summarizes the changes in the distribution and abundance of selected benthic 
        species within sea otter prey communities along the Washington State Olympic 
        coast between 1987 and 1999. During this 12 year period, the Washington 
        otter population has undergone a dramatic increase in both numbers and 
        range, now occupying habitats that were otter free when first sampled 
        in 1987. Quantitative video and in situ counts of invertebrate prey and 
        algal cover at monitoring sites established along the coast in 1987, 1995, 
        and 1999 reveal significant changes occurring as sea otters expanded their 
        range into previously unexploited habitats. Invertebrate prey such as 
        commercially harvested sea urchins that were abundant just outside the 
        boundaries of the 1987 sea otter range are now virtually absent along 
        the entire outer rocky coast. Understory foliose red, coralline, and brown 
        algal cover have also undergone changes as otters removed large invertebrate 
        grazers from the newly occupied habitats.</font></P>

        to address the policy of the State to assess, conserve, restore, and manage 
        California&#146;s ocean resources and the ecosystem as stated in Executive 
        Order No. W-162-97. The purpose of this project is to enable the Department 
        to expand its Geographic Information System (GIS) database to include 
        and make available to CERES, data from the marine subtidal and nearshore 
        ecosystems. The primary components of the project are: GIS mapping of 
        essential marine habitats, nearshore reef fish stock assessment, and marine 
        reserve research. The Early Implementation Phase of this project has focused 
        on accelerating the acquisition of baseline bathymetry and substrate data 
        as outlined in the GIS Mapping of Essential Marine Habitats portion of 
        the project. This effort has included four tasks:<br>
        Task 1) Data Needs: Identification of departmental needs for bathymetry 
        and substrate data.<br>
        Task 2) Data Catalog: Assessment and collection of metadata for currently 
        available data on marine bathymetry and seafloor substrates.<br>
        Task 3) Procedures, Protocols and New Technologies: A review of current 
        and emerging methods and providers for mapping marine habitats.<br>
        Task 4) Data Processing: Process and incorporate existing bathymetric 
        and substrate data into Department GIS coverage themes.</font></P>

      <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">The primary 
        purpose of the Winter Quarters Bay Marine Debris Study (WQBMDS) has been 
        to map and categorize anthropogenic debris in the nearshore marine environment 
        (to 60m) at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Phase I, a systematic survey 
        of the seafloor of Winter Quarters Bay (WQB) and the region between Hut 
        Point and the sea-ice transition road, was conducted during the 1994, 
        1995 and 1996 austral summer seasons using SCUBA, ROV, underwater videography, 
        GPS mapping, and acoustic remote sensing. Two consecutive summers of shorefast 
        sea ice precluded the planned single season survey vessel operations forcing 
        a shift from side scan sonar to ROV video data acquisition. During Phase 
        II, data analysis abnd GIS development, over 1,000 individual debris objects 
        were identified, categorized and geolocated on the seafloor, including 
        603 barrels, 15 vehicles, and 26 large shipping containers and milvans. 
        Water depth and acoustic seafloor classification data were used to produce 
        the most detailed bathymetric map of the McMurdo Station marine habitat 
        to date. These data are now incorporated into the Winter Quarters Bay 
        Marine Debris Study GIS, a multimedia product designed to archive and 
        display georeferenced environmental data for McMurdo Station. <font size="1"><a href="http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/September%2098/bretz.htm">[paper]</a></font></font></P>
